<!-- ## Call for Graduation Projects, Fall 2019 (coming soon ISA) -->

<!-- For interested students in my graduation projects of 2016-2017, this is a list of the projects I am -->
<!-- going to supervise along with a list of [suggested readings](GP) -->


<!-- **1- CAD: Computer Aided Detection of breast cancer using Deep Learning** -->

<!-- The objective is to leverage the new "deep learning" approach of pattern recognition to -->
<!-- enhance the accuracy of the detection algorithms of breast cancer. The prerequisites courses -->
<!-- for joining this project are: probability, pattern recognition, and image processing. To know -->
<!-- about one of the CAD systems visits [LIBCAD](http://libcad.mesclabs.com). -->

<!-- **2- DV: Building a Grammar of Graphics for Data Visualization** -->

<!-- This is a continuation on 2 previous graduation projects (2015 and 2016). To know about data -->
<!-- visualization read (Chen, H{a}rdle, Unwin - 2008 - Handbook of data visualization). To know -->
<!-- one of the interactive data visualization systems visit, -->
<!-- e.g., [DVP](http://dvp.mesclabs.com). It is intended to continue on -->
<!-- the graduation project of this year (2106) to build a complete Grammar of Graphics data -->
<!-- visualization system (Wilkinson et al. - 2006 - The Grammar of Graphics). -->
